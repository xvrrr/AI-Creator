## LLM Config
```
# Agentic-AIGC\environment\config\config.yml 
# Input your LLM API
llm:
  api_key:
  base_url: 
```
Model names may vary depending on the LLM base URL.
The correct model names must be specified in `environment/config/llm.py`.
For direct APIs that support only a single model (e.g., the official GPT series), all model names should be replaced with the corresponding supported model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
## Input Config
```
# Configure the input of cross talk videos in advance (rhythm_agent/news_agent/comm_agent/cross_talk/mad_svc/mad_tts).yml files
# eg. Agentic-AIGC\environment\config\cross_talk.yml
cross_talk:
  reqs: 'Generate a Chinese crosstalk (Xiangsheng) script. The story should be based on objectively existing situations, set against a Chinese background, avoiding examples from other countries. The script should be approximately 40-50 sentences long.'
  audio_path: 'dataset/cross_talk/英文脱口秀1.wav'
  dou_gen: 'dataset/cross_talk/郭德纲'
  peng_gen: 'dataset/cross_talk/付航'
  output: "dataset/user_output_video/cross_talk_video.mp4"
  video_source_dir: "dataset/user_video/"
```
## Character Image for Visual Retrieval Enhancement
```
Under the dataset\video_edit\face_db, add images of the character to be recognized to enhance visual retrieval
The completed character images folders structure should look like this, notice that the name of the character folder must be the same as the character name (eg. Spiderman/Batman/Superman...):

face_db
├── Spiderman ── image01.png
└── Batman ── image02.png

```
## Command Line Usage
```
# With the configuration now complete, proceed to run the following instructions:
python main.py
# The console will output:
Please describe the type of video you would like to produce:
# You can choose Cross Talk、Talk Show、TTS、SVC、Rhythm-Based Editing、Summary of Comment Types、Summary of News
```

# 🎥 Demos & How We Made Them

**Note**: All videos are used for research and demonstration purposes only. The audio and visual assets are sourced from the Internet. Please contact us if you believe any content infringes upon your intellectual property rights.

## 1. 🎬 Agentic Video Editing
Ever dreamed of creating stunning video edits that captivate your audience? With Agentic-AIGC, you can transform your favorite video clips into breathtaking montages that tell your unique story, complete with perfectly synchronized music and transitions.

In **video production and editing**, finding visual information is crucial, as it allows for better alignment with music, audio, or text. Agentic-AIGC extracts useful visual information from videos, and here we use VideoRAG to index and caption videos of unlimited length. You can configure your settings in `videoragcontent.py`

```
class VideoRAG:
    working_dir: str = field(
        default_factory=lambda: f"./videorag_cache_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S')}"
    )
    
    # video
    threads_for_split: int = 10
    video_segment_length: int = 30 # 30 seconds
    rough_num_frames_per_segment: int = 10 # 5 frames
```
Creating videos with Agentic-AIGC requires aligning with the user's ideas, which is a key step. First, the user inputs a query about their video idea, and Agentic-AIGC performs a more granular query decomposition of the user's idea. This results in several sub-queries, each of which can match a video clip in the material library, enabling video creation. When using the Movie Editing feature, the storyboard agent `story_editor.py` percept the available visual material, allowing for more precise generation and utilization of each sub-query.

In the final stage of video production, the duration of each shot may vary. The video editor agent `vid_editor.py` performs fine-grained visual editing based on each retrieved video segment by comparing the video content with the corresponding sub-queries. It selects the moments that best match the visual content with the lowest redundancy for use.


### 1.1 Agentic Movie Edits

🚀 **Technical Details**
- Users just need to prepare the video sources, music audio file and the idea they want.
- Automatically extract music rhythm points (optional) setting threshold & mask parameters.
- Automatically assists with storyboard query design through video content based on user-provided ideas.
- Automatically complete the editing and integration of the video.

In beat-synced video editing, cuts and transitions align with the music's rhythm. We also enhance the narrative through visual storytelling by featuring high-energy visuals during musical climaxes.
In the beat synchronization module, we load .mp3 audio files using librosa and calculate RMS (Root Mean Square) energy to identify rhythmic patterns. The system finds rhythm points by detecting peaks in the energy signal above a configurable threshold, with options to filter out points that are too close together temporally (since viewers may not prefer excessive transitions at the beginning of a video). The video transition times and spectrogram with detected rhythm points are sent to `story_editor.py`, enabling the agent to determine which transitions require high-energy frames.
You can configure your preferences in`music_filter.py`:
```
    # Define mask ranges - times in seconds where you don't want to detect rhythm points
    mask_ranges = [(0, 5)]
    
    # Detect rhythm points
    rhythm_data = agent.detect_rhythm_points(
        energy_threshold=0.4,
        min_interval=3.0,
        smoothing_window=5,
        mask_ranges=mask_ranges
    )
```


#### 1.1.1 *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*
<a href='https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1C9Z6Y3ESo/' target='_blank'><img src='assets/spiderman_cover.png' width=60%/></a>

- Accurately align the storyboard description of the user prompt (eg. 1st, 2nd sections)

Through intelligent analysis of hours of film footage, Agentic-AIGC automatically identifies **rhythm cues**, **high-energy action scenes**, and **character highlights** to achieve precise editing.

📝 **Prompt**:
```
Begin with Gwen with blonde hair sitting at a dining table in front of a window, followed by her playing drums with pop textures and notes in the background.

The 小明剑魔 meme has gained massive popularity recently through his insightful yet comedic streaming commentary. Many content creators have successfully adapted his distinctive speech pattern into creative videos. We've used Agentic-AIGC to generate three videos of this viral meme format, each capturing the unique style and energy of the original while adding new creative elements.

📝 **Prompts**:
```
Video 1:
Background: Mixue Ice Cream is a national chain brand focusing on ice cream and tea beverages. On March 15th (Consumer Rights Day), they were reported to be using overnight lemons. However, compared to other exposures, using overnight lemons isn't considered a particularly serious violation and is somewhat understandable.

- Speaker: Snow King (Mixue's representative)
- Purpose: Emphasize that the **overnight lemon** situation isn't too serious, highlighting Mixue's good reputation
- Must preserve the phrases "Look in my eyes tell me why why baby why", "回答我"
- Must end with the word "说话"
- If the original text contains awkward phrasing, such as redundant words or confused semantics, don't imitate that style or sentence structure
- Ensure natural and fluent sentences
```
```
Video 2:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang (me):
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang (me)
- Start with "**北伐失败怎么不找找自己问题**" (Why don't you look at your own problems for the failure of the Northern Expedition), followed by "...找自己问题" pattern sentences that **all** reference anime events
- Anime examples must mention specific characters
- Only the **last** "...找自己问题" should return to the Northern Expedition scenario
- Use colloquial language and diverse anime references
```
```
Video 3:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang (me):
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang (me)
- Zhuge Liang (me) is challenged about why a certain Three Kingdoms character has a higher rating than him and launches a fierce rebuttal
- Must include: "三点零、十三点零、躺赢狗"
- Do not start with "零杠几"
- Later rating comparisons should show stark differences (can be exaggerated)
- Use colloquial language, align with historical facts, and only replace specific content
```
