## 1. Movie Edits
Ever dreamed of creating stunning movie edits that captivate your audience? With AI-Creator, you can transform your favorite movie clips into breathtaking montages that tell your unique story, complete with perfectly synchronized music and transitions.

🚀 **How AI-Creator Makes Movie Edits**
- Users just need to prepare the video sources, music audio file and the idea they want.
- Automatically extract music rhythm points (optional) setting threshold & mask parameters.
- Automatically assists with storyboard query design through video content based on user-provided ideas.
- Automatically complete the editing and integration of the video.

### 1.1 *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*

- Accurately align the storyboard description of the user prompt (eg. 1st, 2nd sections)

Through intelligent analysis of hours of film footage, AI-Creator automatically identifies **rhythm cues**, **high-energy action scenes**, and **character highlights** to achieve precise editing.

📝 **Prompt**:
```
Begin with Gwen with blonde hair sitting at a dining table in front of a window, followed by her playing drums with pop textures and notes in the background. Include action scenes featuring Miguel O'Hara in his dark blue suit with red accents, sharp red claws and black/red eye lenses, Spider-Gwen in her white and pink suit with hood and ballet shoes, Miles Morales with curly hair and red spider logo on his chest, and The Spot in his black suit covered in white spots using portal powers.

We showcase two distinct edits of *Interstella* created using AI-Creator.

Both edits demonstrate how different prompts can shape the narrative and emotional impact of the same source material.

📝 **Prompt**:
```
Version 1:
Love can transcend time and space.
```
```
Version 2:
Celebrate humanity's courage in space exploration. Include scenes featuring spaceships, wormholes, black holes, space station docking maneuvers, ocean planets, and glacial worlds.

Create a humorous narrative about two PhD students seeking advice from Master Ma. For the two PhD students, one of them is known for high citation counts and the other for numerous publications. Transform martial arts terms into AI research terminology while keeping phrase lengths similar (length difference should be less than two Chinese characters). The story highlights their academic rivalry and ends with Master Ma advising against "窝里斗" (internal competition). Keep signature phrases like "大意了没有闪" (wasn't cautious enough) and "四两拨千斤" (achieving great results with minimal effort) while avoiding mentions of real institutions. The word combinations should be logical and appropriate for an academic context.

The 小明剑魔 meme has gained massive popularity recently through his insightful yet comedic streaming commentary. Many content creators have successfully adapted his distinctive speech pattern into creative videos. We've used AI-Creator to generate three videos of this viral meme format, each capturing the unique style and energy of the original while adding new creative elements.

📝 **Prompts**:
```
Video 1:
Background: Mixue Ice Cream is a national chain brand focusing on ice cream and tea beverages. On March 15th (Consumer Rights Day), they were reported to be using overnight lemons. However, compared to other exposures, using overnight lemons isn't considered a particularly serious violation and is somewhat understandable.

- Speaker: Snow King (Mixue's representative)
- Purpose: Emphasize that the **overnight lemon** situation isn't too serious, highlighting Mixue's good reputation
- Must preserve the phrases "Look in my eyes tell me why why baby why", "回答我"
- Must end with the word "说话"
- If the original text contains awkward phrasing, such as redundant words or confused semantics, don't imitate that style or sentence structure
- Ensure natural and fluent sentences
```
```
Video 2:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang (me):
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang (me)
- Start with "**北伐失败怎么不找找自己问题**" (Why don't you look at your own problems for the failure of the Northern Expedition), followed by "...找自己问题" pattern sentences that **all** reference anime events
- Anime examples must mention specific characters
- Only the **last** "...找自己问题" should return to the Northern Expedition scenario
- Use colloquial language and diverse anime references
```
```
Video 3:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang (me):
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang (me)
- Zhuge Liang (me) is challenged about why a certain Three Kingdoms character has a higher rating than him and launches a fierce rebuttal
- Must include: "三点零、十三点零、躺赢狗"
- Do not start with "零杠几"
- Later rating comparisons should show stark differences (can be exaggerated)
- Use colloquial language, align with historical facts, and only replace specific content
```
